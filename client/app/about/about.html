        <p>This application tries to guess traffic levels in Hervanta area based on real-time position of TKL vehicles in Hervanta area. Location data is fetched via  <a href="http://data.itsfactory.fi" title="SIRI">SIRI service interfaces</a> provided by Tampere Public Transport Information System.</p>

        <p>Because of backend running costs database is currently limited to 15.000 entries. However, one could also store all TKL vehicle data in every second and analyze all that data in Tampere area (in true big data style). This could show for example how ecologically each bus driver operates his or her vehicle (agressive driving produces more CO2 emissions) or perhaps reveal more problem areas in Tampere traffic.</p>
